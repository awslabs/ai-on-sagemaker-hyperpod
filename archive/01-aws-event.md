## SageMaker Code Editor

In this workshop we will use the SageMaker Code Edtior as our work environment where we look at sources, execute scripts, and interact with our cluster.


SageMaker Code Editor is a fully integrated development environment (IDE) based on Visual Studio Code. It provides a rich set of features for data scientists and developers to build, train, and deploy machine learning models. 

### Key Features

- **Intuitive Interface**: Familiar VS Code layout with support for multiple tabs and panels.
- **Integrated Terminal**: Access to a terminal for running shell commands directly within the editor.
- **Extensions**: Support for VS Code extensions to enhance functionality.
- **Collaboration**: Share notebooks and code with team members easily.

### Getting Started

2. **Open the pre-created Studio**: Click the button "Open Studio".
3. **Open Code editor**: From there navigate to "Code Editor" and click launch.
